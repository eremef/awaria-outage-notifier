## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- Rust (stable)
- Android Studio & SDK (for Android builds)
- Global Tauri CLI: `npm install -g @tauri-apps/cli`

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Development

### Desktop

Run the desktop app in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Android

Run on a connected Android device or emulator:

```bash
npm run android
```

## Building

### Desktop app

Build the release bundle:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Android APK

Build the Android APK (unsigned/debug):

```bash
npm run android:build
```

The APK will be located at:
`src-tauri/gen/android/app/build/outputs/apk/universal/release/app-universal-release-unsigned.apk`

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML/JS/CSS in `public/`. Indigo design system with custom HSL tokens.
- **Backend (Rust)**: `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` orchestrates asynchronous fetching from multiple APIs and converts them to a `UnifiedAlert` format.
- **Android Widgets**: Native implementation utilizing a `BaseWidgetProvider` with specific providers for each utility (`TauronWidgetProvider`, `MpwikWidgetProvider`). Includes a `WorkManager` background worker for periodic updates.

## Settings

Settings are stored in `settings.json` in the app's data directory:

- **Desktop**: `%APPDATA%\xyz.eremef.awaria\` (Windows)
- **Android**: `/data/user/0/xyz.eremef.awaria/files/`

## Troubleshooting

- **Widget shows "?"**: The settings haven't been configured yet. Open the main app and set your location.
- **EOF Errors**: Most likely a temporary race condition during settings sync. The app includes resilient logic to retry or fall back to defaults.
- **Missing Alerts**: Check if you have the specific outage category enabled in the settings.
